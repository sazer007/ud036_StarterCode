## Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

## What is it?

**Fresh Tomatoes** is a simple website that displays some of my favorite movies, their posters, and trailers.

## Prerequisites

All you need to get started is to have Python installed. I wrote this using Python 2.7.13 and IDLE, so if you've got those, then you're good!
If you still need to download and install Python, you can do so here:

- [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/)
- [Mac](https://docs.python.org/2.7/using/mac.html)
- [Linux](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/install/linux/)

## Usage

From IDLE, open up `entertainment_center.py` and from the menu, click **Run** and then **Run Module**
Let your mind get blown by the great movies that I enjoy!

## Contributors

Thank you to Udacity for providing the included `fresh_tomatoes.py` which handles taking in the movies and creating the page as you see it in HTML.
Also, thanks Udacity for the great Python instruction I've received so far!
